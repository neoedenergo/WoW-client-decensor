Patches to remove censorship of words from WoW clients.

The WoW client has hardcoded a lot of censorship of thousands of words, like all names of countries, names of cities, names of brands, names of celebrities, etc.

With this patches you can remove all censorship in all the game functionalities (chat, character and pet naming, etc.)

The server also has the ability to censor words in different aspects of the game, what this patch does is just remove the clientside censorship.

THIS IS NOT MY WORK, I found it in an old forum and I wanna keep it here for preservation.
